I've never been much of a writer, but I've always like to document the things I do. Nothing is more satifying than googling for something you need to know the answer for and coming across your own blog post.

I've done lots of different things on the internet but I've never blogged about technology. I'm a network engineer in a large enterprise. I pick up a lot of things along the way though trail and error and this blog I'll record some of these in the hope it might help someone else or even help me to remember.

Thanks for coming along :)
